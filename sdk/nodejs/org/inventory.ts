/**
 * This resource manages the Org Inventory.
 *
 * It can be used to claim, unclaim, assign, unassign, reassign devices.
 *
 * ->Removing a device from the `devices` list or `inventory` map will NOT release it unless `unclaimWhenDestroyed` is set to `true`
 *
 * !> The `devices` attribute (List) is deprecated and is replaced by the `inventory` attribute (Map) as it can generate "inconsistent result after apply" errors. If this happens, it is required to force a refresh of the state to synchronise the new list.\
 * The `devices` attribute will generate inconsistent result after apply when a device other than the last one is removed from the list or when a device is added somewhere other than the end of the list
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import `mist_org_inventory` with:
 *
 * Org Inventory can be imported by specifying the org_id
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import junipermist:org/inventory:Inventory inventory_one 17b46405-3a6d-4715-8bb4-6bb6d06f316a
