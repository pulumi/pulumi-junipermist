/**
 * This resource provides the list of SSO Roles.
 *
 * SSO roles refer to the different functions assigned to users within a Single Sign-On (SSO) system.\
 * These roles determine the tasks and actions that users can perform within the SSO system. There are typically predefined roles and custom roles in an SSO system.\
 * Roles in SSO provide a well-defined separation of responsibility and visibility, allowing for granular-level access control on SSO objects.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as junipermist from "@pulumi/juniper-mist";
 *
 * const ssoRoles = junipermist.org.getSsoRoles({
 *     orgId: "15fca2ac-b1a6-47cc-9953-cc6906281550",
 * });
 * ```
