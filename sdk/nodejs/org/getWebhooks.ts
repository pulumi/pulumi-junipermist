/**
 * This data source provides the list of Org Webhooks.
 *
 * A Webhook is a configuration that allows real-time events and data from the Org to be pushed to a provided url.\
 * It enables the collection of information about various topics such as device events, alarms, and audits updates at the org level.\
 * The Webhook can be set up and customized using the Mist API, allowing users to receive and analyze specific data from a particular site.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as junipermist from "@pulumi/junipermist";
 *
 * const webhooks = junipermist.org.getWebhooks({
 *     orgId: "15fca2ac-b1a6-47cc-9953-cc6906281550",
 * });
